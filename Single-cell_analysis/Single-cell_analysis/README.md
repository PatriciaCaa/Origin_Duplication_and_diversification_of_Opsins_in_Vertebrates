# Single-cell RNA-seq Analysis

This folder contains scripts for processing and analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing data from chick and zebrafish retina samples.

## Scripts

- `04.0_create_seurat_objects_chick.R`: Creates Seurat objects from E12, E16, and E18 chick datasets.
- `04.1_scRNAseq_chick_retina_analysis.R`: Clustering and annotation of chick retinal cells.
- `04.2_zebrafish_retina_analysis.R`: Zebrafish retina single-cell analysis including opsin gene checks.

These scripts were run using Seurat (v4+).  
Results include cluster annotations, UMAP plots, and marker expression visualizations.
