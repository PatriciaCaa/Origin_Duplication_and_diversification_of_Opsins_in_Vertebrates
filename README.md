## Overview

**This project was my final year dissertation project as part of my MSc Bioinformatics course.**

The project focuses on the evolutionary history and functional diversification of opsin genes in vertebrates. 
Opsins, as key light-sensitive proteins in the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, play essential roles in the visual systems of many organisms, enabling a variety of light detection functions. 
By studying opsins, we gain insights into the molecular evolution that allows species to adapt to different light environments and visual requirements.

The study examines opsin gene duplications and losses, and their impact on gene expression patterns across vertebrate lineages.
We utilised a combination of bioinformatics tools, including phylogenomic analyses and single-cell RNA sequencing, to reconstruct the evolutionary history of opsins.
The analysis includes data from 364 vertebrate species and over 500 known opsin sequences, covering a wide taxonomic range.

Our methodology integrates multiple approaches:

    Data Collection: We gathered proteomic and transcriptomic data from public databases, selecting a diverse set of species for a comprehensive analysis.
    Phylogenetic Analysis: To explore the relationships between opsins, we constructed phylogenetic trees, helping to identify conserved and divergent evolutionary paths among these genes.
    Single-Cell Analysis: Single-cell RNA sequencing data was used to analyse opsin gene expression in specific tissues, such as the retina, across different species. 
    This approach allowed us to speculate about cell-type-specific expression patterns and examine how opsins function in various environmental contexts.

Key findings include:

    Significant gene duplications in certain opsin families.
    Identification of conserved opsins that are expressed across a broad range of vertebrates.

This project provides a detailed exploration of opsin evolution, offering valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms that drive visual diversity in vertebrates.
Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the genetic basis for light perception and adaptation, with potential applications in vision science and evolutionary biology.
